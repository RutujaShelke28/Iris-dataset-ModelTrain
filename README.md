# Iris-dataset-ModelTrain

This project focuses on building and training a machine learning classification model using the well-known Iris dataset. The objective of the project is to classify iris flowers into three different species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their physical characteristics. The dataset consists of four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, starting from data loading and exploration to preprocessing and model training. Various Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are used for efficient data handling and manipulation. Data visualization techniques help in understanding feature distributions and relationships between variables.

Machine learning algorithms from Scikit-learn are applied to train the classification model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix are used to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of supervised machine learning and multiclass classification. It demonstrates how simple features can be used to build an effective predictive model and provides a strong foundation for understanding real-world machine learning applications.
